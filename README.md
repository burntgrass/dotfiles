Welcome to my dotfiles!
I made this as a backup because my crusty clumsy hand loves messing up the configuration

- I might as well list the aliases that I made for bash

1) `moo` = `apt`
2) `moos` = `sudo apt`
3) `baa` = `neofetch`
4) `ed` = `nano`
- there's also `dot` but it's for my git stuffs

- for the bash colors, I used https://ezprompt.net
- for my neofetch cheese ascii art, I got it from https://ascii.co.uk/art/cheese

that's all, I may however add pictures of what my desktop look like here later.
